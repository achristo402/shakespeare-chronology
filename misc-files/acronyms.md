**CS**, standing for "Core Shakespeare," is the acronym of the base iteration of this project, from which most of the data
in the essay is pulled. This iteration consists only of Shakespeare's theorized workâ€“texts with disputed authorship are
disaggregated so that only Shakespeare's likely contributions are included.  

In most alternate iterations, a single text is modfied from or added to the CS text list. The name of these iteration folders indicates which text has been changed or introduced, according to the following acronyms:  
  ALCH - *The Alchemist* (Ben Jonson)  
  ARD - *Arden of Faversham*  
  AWW - *All's Well that Ends Well*  
  E3  - *The Reign of King Edward the Third*  
  H8 - *Henry VIII*  
  HAMQ1 - *Hamlet's* First Quarto  
  KNACK - *A Knack to Know a Knave*  
  MUC - *Mucedorus*  
  PER - *Pericles, Prince of Tyre*  
  S1-S5 - Sonnet Groups 1-5  
  SHR - *The Taming of the Shrew*  
  SPTKYD - *The Spanish Tragedy* (Thomas Kyd)  
  TA - *Titus Andronicus*  
  TIM - *Timon of Athens*  
  TNK - *Two Noble Kinsmen*  
  x1H6 - *Henry VI, Part 1*  
  x2H6 - *Henry VI, Part 2*  
  x3H6 - *Henry VI, Part 3*  
  
  Texts that are not included in the CS iteration are tested against the CS text list. For texts that are included in CS in a disaggregated form, the ending of the iteration folder name indicates the change to the text. "nsh" means that the non-Shakespearean sections of the disaggregated text are being tested. "both" means that both the Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean sections of the text are being tested as two separate files. No ending indicates that the text has not been disaggregated, and is being
  tested as a single file.

  MASSIVE -  
  SEMI_MASSIVE -
