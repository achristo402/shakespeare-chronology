**CS**, standing for "Core Shakespeare," is the acronym of the base iteration of this project, from which most of the data
in the essay derives. This iteration consists of work currently posited as Shakespeare’s alone—works of collaborative authorship are disaggregated so that only Shakespeare's likely contributions are included.  

In most alternate iterations, a single text is modified from or added to the CS text list. The name of these iteration folders indicates which text has been changed or introduced, according to the following acronyms:  
  ALCH - *The Alchemist* (Ben Jonson)  
  ARD - *Arden of Faversham*  
  AWW - *All's Well that Ends Well*  
  E3  - *The Reign of King Edward the Third*  
  H8 - *Henry VIII*  
  HAMQ1 - *Hamlet*'s First Quarto  
  KNACK - *A Knack to Know a Knave*  
  MUC - *Mucedorus*  
  PER - *Pericles, Prince of Tyre*  
  S1-S5 - Sonnet Groups 1-5  
  SHR - *The Taming of the Shrew*  
  SPTKYD - *The Spanish Tragedy* (Thomas Kyd)  
  TA - *Titus Andronicus*  
  TIM - *Timon of Athens*  
  TNK - *The Two Noble Kinsmen*  
  x1H6 - *Henry VI, Part 1*  
  x2H6 - *Henry VI, Part 2*  
  x3H6 - *Henry VI, Part 3*  
  
  Texts that are not included in the CS iteration are tested against the CS text list. For texts that are in CS in a disaggregated form, the ending of their iteration folder names indicates the changes to the text. "nsh" means that the non-Shakespearean sections of the disaggregated text are being tested. "both" means that both the Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean sections of the text are being tested as two separate files. No ending indicates that the text has been reaggregated, and is being
  tested as a single file.  
  
  The remaining iterations do not follow this naming convention and are described below:  
  CADBURY - In this iteration, the non-Shakespearean portions of E3 and the
  non-Shakespearean parts of the three H6 plays are swapped into the CS iteration.   
  ARDnsh_TAnsh - In this iteration, both ARDnsh and TAnsh are tested against the CS text list.  
  LRMID - In this iteration, TIM is tested against an equally sized sample of LR (11,071 words) taken from the middle of LR.  
  LRRAND - In this iteration, TIM is tested against an equally sized sample of LR (11,071 words) taken from 36 bands at equidistant intervals across the play.    
  MASSIVE - This iteration tests both the Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean portions of disaggregated texts along with ALCH, HAMQ1, KNACKsh, MUC, SPTKYD, SON145 and the five Sonnet groups.  
  SEMI_MASSIVE - This iteration tests both the Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean portions of disaggregated texts along with SON145 and the five Sonnet groups.  
  SONNETS - This iteration tests all five Sonnet groups and SON145 against the CS iteration.   
  SPTKYD_ARDnsh - In this iteration, SPTKYD is added and ARDnsh is swapped into the CS iteration.  
  SPTKYDanchor - In this iteration, SPTKYD, ARDnsh, and SHRnsh are inserted into the CS iteration.  
  SPTKYDanchor_ARDsh - In this iteration, SPTKYD and SHRnsh are insterted into the CS iteration.  
  TAfly - This iteration tests TA's fly-killing scene against the CS iteration.  
  TA_All - This iteration tests all three portions of TA–TAsh, TAnsh, and TAfly–against the CS iteration.
